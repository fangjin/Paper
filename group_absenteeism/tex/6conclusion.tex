In this paper, we disclose an interesting inactive behavior, group absenteeism in Twitter. We study the group absenteeism phenomena in south American, and propose two group absenteeism approaches: regional group absenteeism and subgraph group absenteeism. The experiment results show that both approach help people to detect some potential social events, such as pandemic, migration of population, and natural disaster. In the future work, we are going to invest the deeper mechanism of the group absenteeism in social network.
